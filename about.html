<p>Ramen Ichiraku (ラーメン一楽, Rāmen Ichiraku, literally meaning: Ramen is the Best Pleasure) is a ramen restaurant in Konohagakure. This is THE most famous ramen restaurant in Konoha village and
this is because the owner focuses on preserving the taste of his ramen under any circumstance.
</p>
<p>
Ramen Ichiraku was founded by Teuchi thirty-four years before the start of Part II. Although it is quite small and has an unassuming appearance, Ramen Ichiraku has always been popular with Konoha's villagers because of Teuchi's strong commitment to taste, giving the ramen an almost artistic quality.

Like any ramen establishment, Ramen Ichiraku offers various toppings, such as char siu and boiled eggs. In Konoha Hiden, seaweed had been the most popular topping for several years until, after the Fourth Shinobi World War, it was surpassed by naruto.
